    - Improve keyboard accessibility for setting hostname
    - Translation updates
  * Stop installing configuration for keyboard shortcuts for screenshots.
    With GNOME Shell 42, this duplicates a similar file shipped by GNOME
    Shell itself; and with gnome-settings-daemon 42, it causes a
    gnome-control-center assertion failure, because those keyboard shortcuts
    have been removed from g-s-d's settings schema. (Closes: #1008493)
  * d/patches: Add various bug fixes from upstream 42.0, via Ubuntu.
    Ubuntu 22.04 is going to stick with gnome-control-center 41.x, so we're
    not upgrading to 42 in Debian either until Ubuntu is further into its
    freeze.
    - This includes a dependency on gsettings-desktop-schemas, so update
